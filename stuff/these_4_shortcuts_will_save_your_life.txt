THIS SHORTCUT WILL CHANGE HOW YOU USE YOUR KEYBOARD

For this article, you'll need:
  Know how to touch-type
  Any IDE or code text editor (Examples shown for Visual Studio Code) 

Here's how writing a book looks like:

And here's how we write code:

[A video with a simplified view of how code is written all over the place]

See the difference? When we write a book, we do it in a continuous stream, but when we write code, we jump around and change little bits of it in different places.

The problem is, changing between typing-mode and cursor-moving-mode takes /time/. How much time?

This sucks. And there's a simple solution. Ready to hear it?

Remap the following keys:
Alt + j = [left arrow]
Alt + k = [down arrow]
Alt + l = [up arrow]
Alt + ; = [right arrow]

you could also do it like this, but I'll tell you later in the article why I prefer doing it this way.

Here it is in action:

You should also remap Shift + Alt + jkl; to select text with this method.

BUT CAN WE GO DEEPER?

We can make our navigation and selection even more efficient by binding the following keys:

Alt + u = [home]
Alt + i = word left
Alt + o = word right
Alt + p = [end]

End goes to the end of the line and toggleHome goes to the beginning of the text in your line, and if you press it again - to the beginning of the line

(Also bind shift+alt+ all of these to selectHome, selectWordRight, etc.)

Here's the final result:
